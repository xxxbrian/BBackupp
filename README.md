### From Release

To install BBackupp from the release page:

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Lakr233/BBackupp/releases) on GitHub.

## ~~Partial Open Source Notice~~

~~Starting from version 2.0, certain components are not included in the open-source repository:~~

- ~~Code interfacing with the App Store API.~~
- ~~User interface components.~~
- ~~MuxProxy related code.~~
- ~~Assets.xcassets~~

~~To build your own BBackupp, you'll need to develop a custom user interface and exclude the features listed above.~~

BBackupp v2.0 is now fully open-source. You can build your own version with the included source code. Please refer to the [License](./LICENSE) for more information.

**I am unable to provide ongoing maintenance for this code due to time constraints. Therefore I made the decision to open-source it.**

**It is unlikely that I will be able to provide support or update the code in the future.**

## MuxProxy

MuxProxy facilitates device discovery in environments where mDNS may not be available, allowing for the use of TailScale or ZeroTier.

![MuxProxy Example](Resource/Readme/SCR-20240322-kihu.png)

For integrating your toolchain with `libusbmuxd` and MuxProxy, launch BBackupp and locate the `Copy Terminal Environment` button under the Muxd menu.

![MuxProxy Menu](Resource/Readme/SCR-20240322-hbbb.png)

If you're considering using a tunnel to connect your device, we strongly recommend a high-speed internet connection. Without it, completing a backup in a timely manner might not be feasible. Please note that we are not responsible for resolving networking issues you may encounter. With the standard Tailscale configuration, transferring device information takes approximately 15 seconds. Optimizing this setup is entirely up to you.

## Transferable Pair Record

Support for transferable pair records allows you to set up a device on one computer and then export the record for use on another machine.

**Note: Not all pair records are compatible with this feature.**

We recommend backing up your device using a wired connection at least once before exporting the record.

> Technical note: The EscowBag (device backup key) is transferred to the host (in this case, your Mac) at an unspecified time. If your pair record already contains this key, it should function correctly.

To register a device without connecting to it directly, navigate to `Import Pair Record` in the `Muxd` menu. Enter an IP address and verify its accessibility.

## Notifications

During the backup process, we'll send notifications at the start and end, as well as if the backup fails.

We currently support the following notification providers:

- [x] Bark (https://github.com/Finb/Bark)
- [x] Telegram Bot (https://t.me/BotFather)
